    This class takes the precipitation properties as inputs and computes the snow

    Attributes:
        rain (np.ndarray): Rainfall in mm for the given timestep.

        snowdens (np.ndarray): Density of the freshly fallen snow in kg/m^3.
        snowdepth (np.ndarray): Calculated depth of snow based on SWE and snow density.

    Methods:
        calculate_snowdepth(water_density): Computes the snow depth using SWE and
